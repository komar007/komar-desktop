# This branch is obsolete

This is an obsolete branch of my dotfiles repository. It is no longer updated.

## `komar007/komar-desktop` -> `komar007/komar-os`

> [!NOTE]
> This repository has been renamed from `komar-desktop` to `komar-os`.

> [!NOTE]
> The default branch of this repository has changed from `master` to
> [`main`](https://github.com/komar007/komar-os/tree/main). This was synchronized with the merge of
> `komar-desktop` with my NixOS configuration. Please see the current default branch
> [`main`](https://github.com/komar007/komar-os/tree/main).

Development on this branch ended in May 2025 and it is now superseded by
[`komar-os/main`](https://github.com/komar007/komar-os/tree/main). Non-obsoleted files from this
branch are still available on the currently default
[`main`](https://github.com/komar007/komar-os/tree/main) branch, albeit in modified form. I am
currently working on converting my configuration to NixOS and Home Manager and all the work is
happening there.

This branch will no longer be updated, but it might contain some disused or legacy config files I
don't need anymore or currently declare using Home Manager, so feel free to use it to your benefit.

> [!NOTE]
> See the current default branch [`main`](https://github.com/komar007/komar-os/tree/main) with my
> dotfiles managed by NixOS & Home Manager.
